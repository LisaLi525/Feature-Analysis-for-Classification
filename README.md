# InsightfulCruiseAnalytics

## Overview

InsightfulCruiseAnalytics is an advanced data analysis project aimed at unveiling deep insights into cruise booking behaviors. Utilizing state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning techniques, this project scrutinizes transactional data from web-based cruise bookings to uncover patterns and preferences in passenger behavior.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Visualization**: Thorough preprocessing and exploration of transactional data, coupled with insightful visualizations.
- **Advanced Feature Selection**: Implements various feature ranking methods including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Stability Selection, and Random Forest feature importance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employs models like Logistic Regression to predict and understand passenger behavior and preferences.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Integrates multiple analytical techniques to ensure a robust understanding of the data.
